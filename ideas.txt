Problem Statement: 
    Given a domain name or ip address block, finding assets and services are not a big problem. For external we have shodan, and for internal, we have nmap. 

    However, it is hard to find an asset that is worth interacting with. There were numerous times when I had to go through list of url endpoints just to see the endpoint was either broken, or was simply giving back 403 or 401. While 403 and 401 might have something, or pentesters who need to test numerous applications in short amount of time, finding applications/servers that actually have something is more important. 

    Problems:
        - URL endpoints broken 
        - Subdomain scraped from ssl certs and various search engines are old and outdated 
        - Need to manually check these endpoints by actually visiting them 

Goal:
    Given a domain name or ip address block, I want to find interactive web applications or web servers - by taking a screenshot.\

    Create tool that is tailored towards South Korean corporations and users 

Tool/Library Selection:
    1. Selenium
        - Pretty much standard, tried and true way to take screenshots. Utilizies headless web drivers. Need the endpoint user to install web drivers that fits their web browser. 

    2. pyppeteer
        - Javascript headless chrome/chromium browser automation library. 
        Looks like it downloads recent version of Chromium(100MB) first, and then launches that as a headless version. Interesting. 


General Procedure 

    1. Take a domain name or ip address block as a file 

    2. if) Domain --> Find subdomains using shodan 
        - Get IP address of the subdomains 
        - Wait I don't even need that if it's a subdomain, DNS is a thing 

    2. if) IP address --> port scan for 80,443,8080? 

    3. Multiprocessing + requests 
        - Visit the endpoint 
            - following redirects? 
            - try/catching various errors (401, 403, timeout, etc...)
    
    4. Take screenshot 

    5. Save screenshot into multiple directories 
        - All screenshot 
        - Potential 

    6. Create a graph of dead subdomains / alive subdomains / uhhh you shouldn't face this server in the internet subdomains (beta, alpha, staging, etc...)
